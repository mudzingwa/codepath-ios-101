## Notes

This was my first attempt at working with Swift, I faced a couple of challenges:
  1. Trying to understand the Swift syntax. However, once I understood it, it was easier to work with.
  2. I faced a bit of challenge getting used to the XCode IDE. However, the video tutorials from CodePath prework helped me.
